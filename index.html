D&D Classes Ranked

D&D is a game that some of you may be familiar with, and if you are you may be familiar with the discussion of what class is best and what is worst. In this post I will go over my ranking of all the D&D classes, from worst to best (I will exclude subclasses). <br><br>
13.	Ranger. Now this is a common one but not without reason, excluding subclass features the <br> base features are very situational and in comparison, to other classes they fall flat. <br> The only good thing about base ranger is that in a survival setting they can be good for foraging that's about it. <br><br>
12.	Articifer. The artificer is the latest addition to the classes, it is very subclass dependant class <br> with not many core features that are combat useful and is mostly focused on infusions <br> (adding properties to items) and they are also a halfcaster with less spell slots. <br><br>
11.	Fighter. The fighter by itself is a very barebones class without its subclasses, only getting <br> more attacks and other minor combat focused abilities. Outside of combat the base fighter <br> is bad, lacking in both outside of combat and story elements. <br><br>
10.	Monk. Even though the monk is my favourite class I can't ignore the major flaws with its <br> base. But even if it lacks in combat, it has lots of story elements like in the later levels you <br> stop feeling the effects of old age and you don't need to eat or sleep. But it relies too much <br> on short rests to regain ki points. <br><br>
9.	Warlock. the warlock is a class like the monk, that relies on short rests to regain abilities. The <br> only reason that it is better than the monk is because they are a full caster, and has a few <br> realy good spells, like eldritch blast and counterspell. <br><br>
8.  cleric. The cleric is the holy man of the D&D classes, with their levels making them more in <br> tune with their god of choice, at higher levles being able to cause divine intervention on a whim (once every 7 days). Most will say that the cleric is the most versatile class, and <br> theye'd be right but that is only with subclasses. <br><br>
7.	Druid. Druids are basically just shapeshifters but only for animals. They are very mediocre <br> although they can have massive health pools at higher levels by turning into larger beasts, <br> they can also be very versatile by turning into animals with swim speeds and fly speeds. <br><br>
6.	Rouge. Playing a rouge will make you feel like an assassins creed protagonist, going in and <br> out of the shadows doing massive damage. But for real the rouge is a very fun class to play <br> and is a fair bit beginner friendly then some other classes. <br><br>
5.	Barbarian. The barbarian is a class summed up by one sentence, me shut off brain, me he hit <br> things hard. An extremely melee combat focused class, with most skills focused on health <br> and damage. <br><br>
4.	Bard. The bard is a half caster class, that will instantly turn you into a badass, with you being <br> able to kill people with insults and bring them to their knees in laughter. This is a half caster <br> done well, with the spellcasting ability complimenting the martial parts. <br><br>
3. 	paladin. If the cleric is the holy man, then the paladin is the crusader, mixing different <br> flavours of smite in with their melee attacks. The paladin is also one of the best classes to 	combo with e.g. a wizard casts heat metal (5th level) on the paladin's sword, then the <br> paladin uses divine smite and thundering smite on the blade and kaboom heaps of <br> damage). <br><br>
2. 	sorcerer. The sorcerer is just a wizard who never needed to study a day in their life, they just <br> have it in their DNA. All in all, the sorcerer isn't as strong as the wizard, but they sure are <br> cooler. Blending pure caster with awesomeness. <br><br>
1. 	wizard. If you know anything about D&D then you should probably know now that the <br> wizard is the best, you should also know why it's the best. Be a glass cannon sure, who cares <br> when you can cast WISH!! And bend space time to your will on a whim. <br><br>
